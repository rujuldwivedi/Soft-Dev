Welcome to the **Knightly**! This is a console-based chess game implemented in Java, designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for chess enthusiasts. The game incorporates classic chess rules, enabling players to challenge themselves against various pieces, including Knights, Bishops, Rooks, Queens, Kings, and Pawns.

## Features

- Playable chess game in the terminal.
- Supports all standard chess pieces with their respective movement rules.
- ANSI color codes for visually appealing text representation of pieces.
- Easy to understand and extend code architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Chess Java game, you'll need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE or a text editor of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rujuldwivedi/chess-java.git
   cd chess-java
   ```

2. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.

3. Compile the code:

   ```
   javac src/*.java
   ```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
java -cp src Game
```

## Gameplay

- The game starts with the standard chess setup.
- Players take turns to move their pieces according to chess rules.
- Invalid moves will be rejected, and players will be prompted to try again.

### Input Format 

To make a move, enter the starting and ending positions of the piece using standard chess notation. The format is as follows:

```
<start_position> <end_position>
```

For example, to move a pawn from e2 to e4, you would input:

``` 
e2 e4
```

### Coordinate System

The chessboard is represented with columns labeled from a to h (from left to right) and rows numbered from 1 to 8 (from bottom to top):

$$
\begin{array}{c|c c c c c c c c}
  & a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\
\hline
8 & ♖ & ♘ & ♗ & ♕ & ♔ & ♗ & ♘ & ♖ & 8 \\
7 & ♙ & ♙ & ♙ & ♙ & ♙ & ♙ & ♙ & ♙ & 7 \\
6 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 6 \\
5 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 5 \\
4 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 4 \\
3 & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & . & 3 \\
2 & ♟ & ♟ & ♟ & ♟ & ♟ & ♟ & ♟ & ♟ & 2 \\
1 & ♖ & ♘ & ♗ & ♕ & ♔ & ♗ & ♘ & ♖ & 1 \\
  & a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\
\end{array}
$$



### Move Validation

- If the input is invalid or does not correspond to a legal move, the game will notify you and ask for a new input.
- Ensure that the start and end positions are valid according to chess rules for the piece being moved.

## Game Rules

### Basic Rules

- Each type of piece has its own movement rules:
  - **Pawn**: Moves forward one square; captures diagonally.
  - **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
  - **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular).
  - **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
  - **Queen**: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.
  - **King**: Moves one square in any direction.

### Winning the Game

- The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.
